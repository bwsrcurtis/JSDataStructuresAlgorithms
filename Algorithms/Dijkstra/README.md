# Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Description

An algorithm for finding the shortes paths between nodes in a weighted graph.

### When To Use

* When you need to find the shortest path, for example in navigation

### Time Complexity

O(Elog(V)) where V is the number of vertices and E is the maximum number of edges attached to a single node.
