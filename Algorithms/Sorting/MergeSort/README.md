# Merge Sort

## Description

Sorting algorithm that works by dividing an unsorted list into n sublists, each containing a single element.
These sublists are then merged to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining, the sorted list.

### When To Use

* When sorting large unsorted lists
* When the data structure doesn't support random access

### Time Complexity

O(Nlog(N))
