# Doubly Linked List

## Description

A data structure tha contains a head, tail, and length property. A linked list consists of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null. In a soubly linked list, each node points to both the previous and the next node.

### Usefulness

Better than singly linked lists for finding nodes and can be done in half the time. The extra pointer does cause more memory to be used.
