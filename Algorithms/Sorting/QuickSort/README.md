# Quick Sort

## Description

Efficient, general-purpose sorting algorithm.
Slightly faster overall than merge sort for large randomized data.
It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.
The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.

### When To Use

* When the data structure is large and completely random

### Time Complexity

O(Nlog(N))
